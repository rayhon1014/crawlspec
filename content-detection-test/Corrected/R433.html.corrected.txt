Abdrew your google chrom ad is messing up the video copilot experience, normally I would x it out but its doing something wacky and will not show me the x. I always thought you should have a 15 second ad in front of all your videos to create revenue for your site and for some compensation for making the videos.

1. You never Rotobrush a whole clip in one segment.
2. Rotobrush is a mediocre experimental tool that only works in very limited situations.
3. A good mask > Rotocrap

I rather spend 15 minutes doing something right that 3 minutes doing a sloppy job.

WORDDD. Hate rotobrushing. A good mask never fails.

The Great Escape... brilliant. That really made me laugh.

BTW: The Great Escape is coming to the big screen in October as part of the Cinema Classics series at the Cinemark theatres.

Great Tutorials. You are a master!

I'm really glad to see that I'm not the only one spending forever rotoscoping out elements - even when using the RotoBrush.

Not meant as a comment on your ability to use the rotobrush Andrew, just comforting to know that some things just take time.
Always wondered whether, even with some experience in VFX, I was missing something when it takes me quite while to get a really clean rotoscope job done well :D

creates something new innovadorcomo a plugin element 3d realistic water
ocrea another 3d program but create relista seawater as the movie 2012 when the boat flips or movie in 2012 when Ben behind the limo and seva elllos breaking the floor is raised or when they go on the plane and destroyed buildings and cars of the freeway fall very cool but realistic as create a city with a realistic program for affter effecs or when the volcano explodes and loose rocks and giant flames burn the camper empiesa creates something innovative as things proyectile 2012 with weapons but I hope you read this

should create an effect like the movie 2012 as when the earthquake or tsunami avre floor as when the ship goes to the giant wave
effects of water you should create or open the land like sanandreas fault but 3d creations

he is showing techniques for a semi/pro video producers. Nuke is for PRO high budget movie production. Program which most of us will never be able to afford or in fact need at all.

so in my opinion, Andrew you are doing an awesome job, thx for all the tutorials and great plugins! respect

look andrew kermer its great work but it still no profesional nuke it much better than after effct
nuke x please i hate this shit
next level please

Me
09/07/2012
Btw, using nuke doesnt make you a pro, talent does. How about posting some of your Nuke work here so we can see how much better it is? I didnt think so, troll.
Me
09/07/2012
Studios use AE along with Nuke. Both are professional tools. If you had any experience you would know that.

If you have any problem working with nuke, there is a place in this site called forum. You can get all your doubt cleared over there.

Andrew terrific tutorial as always.
Null Normalization is a logical step, but
something I noticed and you correct me. Null objects are normalized and placed in the center of the world, but later you have to position the background, to move away from the center of the composition or the world in the distance. In tutorial 13 min and 55s. Why normalize when the Null again far away from centar. Thank in advance.

Awesome work, am new to after effects and premiere.. just got myself iMac and very keen to make some movies of my own. I am deaf, Is it possible if you could add captions/subtitles to your tutorials so I can get better understanding of what your exactly doing as I find it hard try follow the arrow etc.

Cheers Anto

that's why I love the way he teach us because he always have a sense of humor.. like in the tablet, where can we see a tablet that operates a WINDOWS 95. LOL
he's not boring to listen and he make us more interested of what he share.

you can use CameraTracker Plugin... it's working well on CS5
Doug

Cool! Maybe you can talk about what to do, and what not to do in a matte painting. I noticed a lot of people adding in motion elements like spaceships flying. Obviously this is not good to work with. So maybe you can explain that to the matte painting noobs.

nice tutorial ... may god reward you

extentions is one of the best techniques to make a dramatic and exiting environnement .. it's not very complex although the results are astonishing ..


the foundry camera tracker is the best option for doing the tricks ,, it's not expensive and cool !!

So it's crucial to make your set extensions longer than the still if you plan on panning around something. Now you tell me!
If I can just extend my set extension . . .I'm so close to being done. Thanks Andrew!

@Avinash bro I am using CS5 and i cant find .MOV extension. could anyone please explain me where it is exactly???? and i used h.264 but the HD did not look like a HD video, i dont know how to edit the h.264 settings, i tried some from online but nothing satisfied me. then i tried h.264 blue ray but the system turns off on a flash exactly after half the render has been done!! this makes me sick!! someone help me :( Andrew we are badly in need of your help :( please make a video for the CS5 and CS6 user's for rendering files!!
Avinash
09/04/2012
MOV file type seems to be best for rendering quality videos while conserving on hard drive space. Thats what i would recommend, also check out the h.264 codecs and so on. But im using MOV

Be sure to match the light direction to your background so that you do not have multiple shadow directions when placing foreground images from Element. :)
